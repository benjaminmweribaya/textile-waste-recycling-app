# Benito Fashions Upcycling & Recycling App

## Project Overview
*Benito Fashions* is a sustainable fashion brand dedicated to promoting environmental conservation through the upcycling and recycling of textiles, shoes, clothing, and accessories. The goal is to create a platform that not only facilitates donations and collections of pre-owned items but also offers a marketplace for eco-friendly products made from waste materials like plastics, glass, and textile scraps.

This application serves as a bridge between eco-conscious consumers, environmentally active communities, and Benito Fashions' production unit—encouraging conscious consumption and promoting a circular economy. The Benito Fashions Recycling & Upcycling App aims to revolutionize sustainable fashion by providing an innovative platform for recycling and upcycling textile waste.

## Get Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the app**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   This will start the Expo development server. You'll see options to open the app in:
   - [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
   - [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)

   You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

3. **Get a fresh project**

   When you're ready, run:

   ```bash
   npm run reset-project
   ```

   This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
